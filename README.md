# Hand-gestures-voice-and-remote-controlled-car
A car that can be controlled via a user's hand gestures, voice, and smartphone. It utilizes ESP8266 NodeMCU, MediaPipe, Blynk console, Blynk API, and IFTTT. 

Users can define their preferred hand gestures by modifying the 'Project.ipynb' code, tailoring the control mechanism to match their gestures of choice. By default, the hand gesture control includes the following gestures: 
No finger up: Stop
1 finger up: Move forward
2 fingers up: Move backward
3 fingers up: Turn left
4 fingers up: Turn right

By modifying the 'Project_nodemcu.ino' code, users can re-define the movements that correspond to individual hand gestures. 

The hardware requirements of this Project include: a ESP8266 NodeMCU, a motor driver, BO motors, and 3.7V Lithium-Ion rechargeable cells.
